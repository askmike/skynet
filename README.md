# Skynet

We, a group of students from the [Amsterdam University of Applied Science](http://www.international.hva.nl/), are doing research on improving the attention towards public screens by using Computer Vision techonlogy.

We have a physical setup at our local university building with a screen and a webcam. [VANturelabs](http://vanturelabs.com/) has provided us with audience measurement software running on the setup. Skynet listens to this system and uses this to:

1. Adapt the content on the screen in realtime to the audience.
2. Gather statistics of the attention of the audience.

Skynet consists of a (nodejs) server application and a (webbased) client application which listens to the server for when to display what kind of content.
